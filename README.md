# Directed Percolation and DP 2
DP and DP2 simulation for **Physics of Complex Systems** exam.

In the .pdf presentation you can find the descripion of the project and the methods used to simulate the models and to compute the critical exponents.

In the notebook you can find the functions used to simulate the models and to drow the simulations.
